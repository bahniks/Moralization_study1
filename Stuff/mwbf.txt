After a minor work slip (e.g., error/ delay/ misunderstanding), I felt morally bad in a way that lingered beyond the workday.
I interpreted neutral performance feedback as a judgment of my character (not just my work).
I over-corrected or re-did submitted work because I felt I had to “make amends” for a mistake.
In routine tasks, I noticed and mentally flagged potential moral stakes (e.g., fairness, harm, privacy).
I caught myself framing a routine choice in “right vs. wrong” terms rather than “productive vs. unproductive.”
I added a micro-check (e.g., consent/ attribution/ privacy/ fairness step) to a task specifically to avoid moral harm.
I felt moral distress when a task conflicted with my values.
I felt morally uplifted or proud after completing a task because it aligned with my values.
I reframed a mundane task as part of a larger moral purpose to keep myself engaged.
