Prague Zoo welcomes four new baby capybaras|
Four baby capybaras have been born at Prague Zoo. 

Visitors can see them in the Water World and Monkey Islands section, where they arrived on September 18 to a female named Bára. 

Capybaras are the world’s largest rodents and are known for their calm, friendly nature. Because they are in high demand among zoos, the young ones will eventually move to other institutions. 

Prague Zoo last kept capybaras in 2013, but floods destroyed their enclosure and ended the breeding program. After a ten-year pause, the zoo reintroduced them in November 2023. 


Pumpkin World Amusement Park is Now Opened to Public|
A seasonal amusement park for children, named Pumpkin World (Dýňový svět), will open in the Czech village of Nová Ves u Leštiny on Saturday, September 20.

The Pipkovi family first opened their “pumpkin world” in 2010. “We decided to try growing pumpkins. It worked, so we started selling them at the market and later here on the farm. But we wanted to add something extra so people had a reason to come, so we created the pumpkin world,” Pipková recalled.

Both children and adults will have the opportunity to delight in a pyramid composed of thousands of pumpkins, a maze, an obstacle course, and a workshop where everyone can learn how to carve the famous Jack-o’-lantern and other sculptures from this colorful vegetable.
