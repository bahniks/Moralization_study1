When I do my job poorly, I don't see it merely as a sign of carelessness, incompetence, or ignorance, but as a moral failing.
When I fail to complete my work duties on time, I don’t see it as merely poor performance, but as a reflection of my own moral flaw.
If I fail at my job, even in small things, I feel like I’ve failed as a moral person. 
When someone criticizes the outcomes of my work, I usually experience it as a moral failure on my part, not just as a possible mistake or a lack of knowledge.
Feedback about my poor performance often triggers a sense of moral failure in me.
I don’t think I need to reflect morally on every job-related task I perform.
Every task I do at work carries moral weight—there’s always an ethically right and an ethically wrong way to do it. 
When I complete a task, it’s important to me to evaluate whether I did it in an ethically good or bad way.
I reflect on the moral implications of small decisions (e.g., reporting time, expenses, email wording).
Even mundane tasks at work are meaningful to me because they are a part of doing the right thing.
Work gives me the feeling that my life has a moral purpose.
Doing my job properly is something I see as a moral conviction I should hold as an employee, not just a contractual obligation.
I see my job mainly as time for pay; it’s not part of any moral purpose.
