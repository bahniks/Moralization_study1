Prague Zoo welcomes four new baby capybaras|
Four baby capybaras have been born at Prague Zoo. 

Visitors can see them in the Water World and Monkey Islands section, where they arrived on September 18 to a female named Bára. 

Capybaras are the world’s largest rodents and are known for their calm, friendly nature. Because they are in high demand among zoos, the young ones will eventually move to other institutions. 

Prague Zoo last kept capybaras in 2013, but floods destroyed their enclosure and ended the breeding program. After a ten-year pause, the zoo reintroduced them in November 2023. 


Pumpkin World Amusement Park is Now Opened to Public|
A seasonal amusement park for children, named Pumpkin World (Dýňový svět), will open in the Czech village of Nová Ves u Leštiny on Saturday, September 2o.

The Pipkovi family first opened their “pumpkin world” in 2010. “We decided to try growing pumpkins. It worked, so we started selling them at the market and later here on the farm. But we wanted to add something extra so people had a reason to come, so we created the pumpkin world,” Pipková recalled.

Both children and adults will have the opportunity to delight in a pyramid composed of thousands of pumpkins, a maze, an obstacle course, and a workshop where everyone can learn how to carve the famous Jack-o’-lantern and other sculptures from this colorful vegetable.


New Arctic Pavilion to House Polar Bears and Seals|
Prague Zoo has begun construction on a state-of-the-art Arctic Pavilion, set to open in 2028.

Prague Launches Mobile Game That Lets You Build the City|
Prague City Tourism (PCT) has released a mobile puzzle game called Playing Prague, aiming to promote the city through a blend of interactive storytelling, architecture, and local legends.

Players solve strategic puzzles as they build iconic Prague monuments across different city districts. Each level highlights a different neighborhood and increases in difficulty. Along the way, users meet historical and cultural figures — from Mozart to Věra Čáslavská — all of whom have shaped Prague’s identity.

Charles Games’ developer Lukáš Kolek explains that the gameplay merges relaxation with challenge: “You build the city by combining tiles, unlocking levels dedicated to famous locations like the Powder Tower, Charles Bridge, or Petřín.”

He adds, “We tried to capture Prague’s distinct atmosphere — a city we love deeply. At the same time, we wanted to offer players the chance to build their own version of Prague.”


A Metro-Style High-Speed Rail Could Connect All of Europe by 2040|
A visionary blueprint from European think tank 21st Europe proposes a continent-wide high-speed rail network called Starline, designed to function like a metro system connecting 39 major hubs across Europe. With trains reaching speeds of up to 400 km/h, journeys such as Helsinki to Berlin could take just over three hours, transforming long-haul travel into a fast, sustainable experience. 

The project aims to reduce short-haul flights by 80% and cut transport emissions by up to 95%, while boosting regional economies and accessibility. Inspired by the symbolism of grand cathedrals and public squares, Starline stations would serve as architectural landmarks and vibrant community spaces. If realized, the network could redefine European mobility and identity, making even remote regions feel just a few stops away.
